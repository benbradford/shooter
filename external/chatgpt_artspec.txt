🧱 2D Dungeon Action Game — Visual & Sprite Sheet Spec (Draft v1)
1. Game Overview (Context I Should Always Assume)

Game type: 2D top-down action game

Camera: Orthographic, fixed top-down

Grid system:

World is built on a 64×64 pixel grid

One tile = one gameplay cell

Art inspiration: Metal Slug

Cartoon-realistic

Chunky shapes

High readability

Stylized, not photoreal

2. Core Rendering Rules (Very Important)

These are non-negotiable unless you explicitly say otherwise:

❌ No baked lighting

❌ No gradients

❌ No vignettes

❌ No soft shadows

❌ No ambient shading

✅ Uniform brightness edge-to-edge

✅ All depth/readability comes from:

Line work

Color contrast

Texture variation

3. Tile & Sprite Rules
Tile Size

All tiles: 64×64 px

Walls, floors, platforms each consume exactly one grid cell

Never mix wall + floor + platform in the same tile

Seamlessness

Floor & platform tiles must be:

Seamless horizontally and vertically

No visible seams when tiled repeatedly

4. Floors (Dungeon)
Dirt-Over-Stone Floor

Mostly compacted brown dirt

Subtle stone texture showing through

❌ No obvious tile-shaped stones

Small bones / debris:

Baked into the base texture

Not overlays unless explicitly requested

Cartoon-realistic texture density

Fully seamless

5. Walls

Walls are separate sprites from floors/platforms

Consume exactly 1 grid cell

Styled to match dungeon:

Aged stone

Chunky outlines

High contrast edges

Never appear inside floor or platform tiles

6. Platforms (Raised Walkable Areas)

Platforms are flat walkable surfaces

No wall faces baked in

No side shading

Platform height is implied by:

Walls

Edges (handled separately)

Platform Tops

Stone-based texture

Subtle noise / cracks

No obvious repetition

Seamless

Uniform brightness

Platform Edges

Not required in the base tile

May be:

Separate sprites

Or drawn procedurally by the game

Sprite variants are acceptable only if:

Each variant is still 64×64

Alpha background

No wall faces baked in

7. Sprite Sheets
Padding

4 px padding between sprites (minimum)

Transparent background (alpha)

Consistency

All sprites in a sheet:

Same dimensions

Same brightness range

Same line thickness

No beige/halo artifacts

No semi-transparent edge pixels unless intentional

Engine Safety

Sprites must be extractable by:

Fixed coordinates

Fixed widths/heights

No visual bleed across sprite bounds

8. Overlays & Decals

Used sparingly

Must be:

Pixel-crisp

Hard edges

No soft alpha fades

Purpose:

Break repetition

Add grime, bones, cracks

Must not introduce lighting cues

9. UI / HUD Icons

Square icons

Pixel-art

High contrast

Readable at small sizes

Clear silhouette first, detail second

Same stylistic family as world art

10. What You Can Assume About My Behavior

When working on this project, I should:

Think in engine constraints first

Ask before violating any rule above

Prefer specs and coordinates over vibes

Treat image generation as final-asset-ready, not concept art

❌ HARD “DO NOT DO” RULES — Ground Overlays & Hole Sprites

These are non-negotiable constraints for this project.

1. ❌ NEVER bake ground into overlay sprites

Hole sprites must NEVER include any surrounding dirt, stone, floor, or fill

The floor already exists underneath

The sprite must visually “sit on top” of any floor type

Correct:

Only the hole rim + interior darkness + debris
Incorrect:

Hole + square of dirt around it

Hole blended into a fake ground patch

Hole with feathered background

2. ❌ NO opaque or semi-opaque backgrounds

Background must be 100% transparent (true alpha)

No beige, brown, grey, blurred, vignetted, or “helper” background

No soft edge fade into transparency

Allowed pixels:

Fully opaque (hole rim, debris)

Fully transparent (everything else)

Disallowed:

5–20% alpha pixels

Soft shadows fading into nothing

Anti-aliased transparency halos

3. ❌ NO text, labels, guides, or framing

No words like “Active / Damaged / Destroyed”

No outlines, borders, boxes, or preview framing

Spritesheets are raw assets, not presentation images

4. ❌ NO lighting, shading, or fake depth from the environment

The hole provides its own internal depth only

No directional light

No shadow cast onto the ground

No vignette inside the tile bounds

Depth should come from:

Darker interior color

Broken rim silhouette

Pixel contrast — not gradients

5. ❌ NO tile-bound assumptions

Hole sprites are not tiles

They do not align to grid seams

They may overlap multiple underlying tiles visually

They must work when:

scaled in

scaled out

animated

placed on any floor texture

✅ POSITIVE CONSTRAINTS (What SHOULD happen)
Hole Sprite Definition

Canvas: 64×64 (or explicitly defined size)

Background: 100% transparent

Content:

Jagged rim

Interior darkness

Optional debris (bones, stones)

Edges: Hard pixel edges (Metal Slug–ish)

State Variants (If using a mini-sheet)

Each state differs only in damage, never in background:

Active

Clean rim

Deep interior

Damaged

Cracked rim

Chipped stones

Destroyed

Collapsed rim

Rubble filling hole

Still transparent outside rubble

🔁 Why this matters (engine-side)

Because you:

Scale the sprite in/out

Layer it over procedural floors

Use particle effects

Reuse it across biomes

Any baked ground or semi-alpha instantly:

Reveals scaling artifacts

Creates visible squares

Breaks tiling illusion

Fights your floor texture work

🧠 Internal reminder for me (plain English)

If the sprite wouldn’t look correct pasted over any random floor, it’s wrong.

No exceptions.
